# About Me

Hello! I'm **Yidong Zhou**, a physicist with a deep passion for the intersection of artificial intelligence product and quantum computing in the real world.

## Education 🎓

I pursued my Sc.M in Physics from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). Here, I've had the opportunity to delve deep into the world of Quantum Computing and Advanced Quantum Mechanics. I began my academic journey at [Nankai University](http://www.nankai.edu.cn/), where I earned my Sc.B in Applied Physics.

## Honors & Awards 🏆

I've always been passionate about physics, which led me to secure the **First Award** at the Chinese Physics Olympiad (CPhO). I was also a proud recipient of the **Poling Class Scholarship** at Nankai University, an award dedicated to students who excel in math, physics, and chemistry.

## Professional Experience 💼

Currently, I'm a **Research Assistant** at the Physics Department of Brown University. My work primarily revolves around researching Quantum Advantage feasibility on physics problem solutions and optimizing quantum algorithms.

Prior to this, I was a **Curriculum Manager & Machine Learning Engineer** at Megvii Inc.. There, I worked on designing an AI teaching platform, quantizing AI models, and actively participated in AI Bootcamps.  

I also work as a part-time acdemic tutor, where I'm teaching college physics/math and also AI with Phsyics special subject.
## Projects 🛠

Some of the exciting projects I've worked on include:
- **Statistics of Classical Nonlinear Dynamical Systems**
  - Investigated NISQ devices in solving the linear Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) to understand the probabilistic distribution of quantum systems.
  - Developed simulations using Python and Julia, comparing classical approaches with newer methodologies.
  - Collaborated with a team of five researchers to optimize algorithms for better computation efficiency.
  - Presented findings at the APS March Meeting 2023, receiving commendations for the innovative approach.

- **Megvii AI Curriculum**
  - Designed computer vision education textbooks, creating a comprehensive learning resource for both beginners and intermediate learners.
  - Developed hands-on teaching code and materials using MegEngine, ensuring practical applicability and enhancing student engagement.
  - Collaborated with Product and Engineering teams, refining the content authoring process over ten iterative versions.
  - Organized and delivered over 50 lectures and training bootcamps at colleges, enhancing Megvii's brand in educational spaces.
  - Successfully promoted the curriculum to over 10 universities in China, culminating in its adoption as an official course in one prestigious college.

- **Face Recongnition Terminal Deployment Competition**
  - Initiated and organized Megvii's first-ever Face Recognition Terminal Deployment Competition to challenge and test the efficiency and accuracy of face recognition models in real-world scenarios.
  - Designed competition metrics and evaluation criteria based on precision, recall, and speed, ensuring fairness and transparency throughout the competition.
  - Collaborated with the engineering and product teams to set up an efficient submission and feedback system, allowing participants to iteratively improve their solutions.
  - Held seminars and workshops leading up to the competition, equipping participants with knowledge and tools for optimal model deployment.

- **Implementation of Deep Learning in New Particle Searching**
  - Implemented a seven-layer MLP architecture for classifying events in Dark Matter Searching Experiments, focusing on accuracy and computational efficiency.
  - Utilized advanced optimization techniques to train the model, achieving convergence faster than traditional methods.
  - Achieved exceptional accuracy in classification with a stable error rate, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

- **Face Recognition Access Control Terminal**
  - Implemented a robust face detection pipeline, leveraging advanced computer vision algorithms and deep learning. Integrated the solution into an Android-based terminal, ensuring real-time face recognition and authorization checks.
  - Collaborated with a cross-functional team to deploy the terminals in various commercial settings, including offices and malls.
  - Achieved a reduction in unauthorized access incidents by 50%, enhancing security and user trust.
  - Conducted multiple iterations based on real-world feedback, further improving the system's accuracy and reliability.

## Technical Proficiency 🖥

I am fluent in both Mandarin and English. Technically, I'm well-versed in Python, Java, C++, and Linux. I have hands-on experience with a suite of tools such as Qiskit, Amazon Braket, Git, Tensorflow, Pytorch, Scikit, AWS, and Megengine, to name a few.
