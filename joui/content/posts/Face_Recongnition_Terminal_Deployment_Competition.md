When we talk about the revolutionary strides in AI and face recognition technology, few experiences come close to the excitement and learning that my role as the organizer of the **Face Recognition Terminal Deployment Competition** brought. Organized under the aegis of **Megvii Inc.** in Beijing, China, this competition became a pivotal point not only for the company but also for the broader AI community. In this article, I will share a detailed account of my product management experience during the competition.

## A Spark of Inspiration

The inspiration for the competition stemmed from a pressing question: **How efficient and accurate are face recognition models when deployed in real-world scenarios?** With this objective in mind, we embarked on the journey to create Megvii's first-ever such competition.

## Building The Foundation

Creating a competition of this scale was not just about having participants submit their models. It was crucial to set the right criteria and metrics for evaluation. We worked tirelessly to design metrics rooted in **precision, recall, and speed**. This ensured that the competition remained transparent and fair, holding true to Megvii's ethos.

## The Power of Collaboration

A crucial component of this competition's success was the cross-functional collaboration. Our engineering and product teams came together to set up an efficient submission and feedback system. This played a critical role as it allowed participants to iterate and improve their solutions, fostering a spirit of continuous learning and improvement.

## Empowering Participants

Before the main event, it was crucial to ensure participants were equipped with the right tools and knowledge. Through a series of workshops and seminars, we dove deep into the nuances of model deployment, sharing best practices and insights. This was not just about the competition, but about enriching the AI community with knowledge.

## Diverse Participation

One of the highlights of this competition was its broad appeal. We saw participation from over **30 teams**, spanning a diverse spectrum from academic researchers to industry professionals. This diversity brought in a mix of unique perspectives, approaches, and solutions, making the competition a hotbed for innovation.

## Making Waves in the Industry

The competition was not just an internal milestone. It garnered significant media attention, establishing Megvii as a forerunner in face recognition technology. By hosting this competition, we were able to fortify Megvii's brand presence among top AI professionals and academic institutions.

## In Conclusion

My role as the organizer of the Face Recognition Terminal Deployment Competition was more than just managing a project. It was about fostering collaboration, promoting innovation, and positioning Megvii as an industry leader. The myriad challenges, the collaborations, and the eventual success of the event have been instrumental in shaping my perspective on product management.

For anyone aspiring to dive into product management or organize large-scale events, remember that the journey is as important as the destination. Embrace challenges, champion collaboration, and always strive to add value to your community.
