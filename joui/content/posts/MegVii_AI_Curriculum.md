# Bridging the Gap: My Journey with Megvii and the Fusion of AI, Curriculum, and Project Management Methodologies  

When one mentions "Megvii Inc.", rapid advances in artificial intelligence might be the first thought. However, during my stint as a Product Manager at this AI powerhouse, I experienced and contributed to a unique blend: the merger of state-of-the-art AI education and structured project management methodologies, namely Agile and Waterfall.

## **Crafting AI Education with Face++**

At the outset, our goal was audacious: we aimed to create captivating AI-focused lessons, projects, and platforms. Central to these endeavors was [Face++](https://www.faceplusplus.com/), an innovative AI platform developed on Megvii's MegEngine. Our vision was not confined to tech aficionados; we wanted AI education to be accessible, meaningful, and invigorating for all learners.  

The scope of this project includes creating reusable learning objects that consist of end-to-end machine learning which means from theory to deployment(data cleansing collection and generating datasets to edging computing IoT and smart city).

To further reinforce the theoretical concepts, we have designed in-class assignments as well as homework to encourage students to apply the knowledge they have acquired. Moving from theory to practice, we have also designed some competitions among several universities in China such as the Face Recognition Terminals Deployment Competition, allowing students to translate their theoretical knowledge into real-world applications. We also set up an internal boot camp based on our curriculum to offer ML learning opportunities for the other developers and project managers.

A standout feature of our project is that all of our materials and competitions are based on Megvii’s own open-source platform, MegEngine. We have introduced a dedicated learning platform called MegStudio to facilitate the learning process. On MegStudio, we provide access to open-source databases as well as models that are developed on our own platform.

We have adopted a modular approach to learning design, ensuring that our course is adaptable to individuals with all levels of expertise. Recognizing that quality education should be accessible to all, we have strived to make our materials available at different price points. We offer premium computational resources on a subscription basis, which acts as a revenue model for our platform. We also offer free computational resources based on users’ daily activity to reinforce the viscosity of users.

In addition to educational goals, our platform serves a dual purpose as a recruitment tool. We host competitions through MegStudio, which enables us to identify and recruit exceptional talent, effectively integrating education and talent into a seamless process.  

## **Melding Traditional and Modern Methodologies**

Given AI's dynamic nature and the constantly shifting needs of our users, a flexible, adaptable, and swift methodology was paramount. This nudged us towards the Agile framework, especially while crafting the computer vision education textbooks.

Agile's iterative model facilitated our work in sprints. We absorbed feedback from educators and students, implementing real-time adjustments. For instance, our content authoring process experienced over 10 evolutions in a brief period. Every iteration reflected the real-world user feedback and our team's unwavering commitment to excellence.

Conversely, projects of larger magnitude, like our outreach to universities across China, demanded the structured rigor of the Waterfall methodology. Each step, from liaising with educational institutions to the final implementation, was meticulously orchestrated.

## **Tangible Achievements**

A hallmark moment was the AI Bootcamp, an immersion into the complexities of AI models, including VGG16 and ResNet50. Harnessing the power of MegEngine, we unveiled a project that detected city trash bins with an impressive 95% accuracy rate. This endeavor symbolized the union of knowledge (our curriculum), technology (MegEngine), and methodology (Agile's iterative refinement).

## **Disseminating the Knowledge**

What value does knowledge hold if not shared? Another pivotal achievement was our **Megvii AI Curriculum** initiative. Utilizing Agile tools like Jira, our team successfully introduced our curriculum to over 10 universities in China. Furthermore, we helmed more than 50 lectures and training bootcamps. The pinnacle of this journey was the inclusion of our program in a college's official course list in China.

## **In Retrospect**

This chapter at Megvii imparted a critical insight: the choice of tool (or methodology) must resonate with the challenge at hand. As futuristic as AI seems, when paired with tried-and-tested methodologies like Agile and Waterfall, the impact can be monumental.

In the confluence of past strategies and future tech, I eagerly anticipate the evolutions and revolutions in AI education. The journey continues.
